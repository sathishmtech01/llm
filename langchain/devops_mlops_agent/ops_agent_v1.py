üìç Flow Summary:
See above.

üö® Error Highlights:
- `payment`: Timeout while calling billing provider
- Multiple retries followed by fatal error
- Gateway ended with 502

üìå Suspected Root Cause:
- `payment` service failed to connect to billing provider, causing a downstream failure.

üõ† Suggested Fix or Next Steps:
- Check billing provider health and network.
- Add circuit breaker to prevent retries.

You are an expert observability assistant performing root cause analysis (RCA) on a single trace of execution across services.

You are given a log flow. Each line includes:
- timestamp
- service
- error_level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- message

All logs belong to one trace_id. Reconstruct the flow, identify issues, and suggest a fix.
